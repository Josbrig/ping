# AI Agent TODO List for the Ping Statistics Project

- [x] Set up base project structure (CMake project, folder layout src/include/tests/docs/plans)
- [X] Create central architecture file ([`docs/architecture.md`](docs/architecture.md)) describing the modules
- [X] Design interfaces for PingSession, StatisticsAggregator, TargetConfig, ConsoleView, PlatformPingBackend
- [X] Create CMakeLists.txt for the main project and subdirectories if needed
- [X] Implement basic ICMP ping for a single target on Linux
- [X] Adapt basic ICMP ping for macOS
- [X] Implement portable PlatformPingBackend abstraction for Linux/macOS/WSL/Cygwin/MinGW
- [X] Implement PingSession (periodic pinging, forwarding measurements to StatisticsAggregator)
- [X] Implement StatisticsAggregator (min/max/mean/median, packet loss, histogram buckets, time-series buffer)
- [X] Implement ConsoleView (table view, time-series graphic, histogram output, periodic refresh)
- [X] Implement command-line interface in main (targets, -i interval, --output-format, --output-file)
- [X] Implement CSV export of statistics
- [X] Implement JSON export of statistics
- [X] Create unit tests for statistical calculations (min/max/mean/median, histogram)
- [X] Create integration tests for ping workflow with multiple targets
- [X] Define CMake targets for tests and set up automated test execution
- [ ] Align console output with the description in README.md and adjust if needed
- [ ] Test build configurations for Debug/Release on all target platforms
   - Operating systems with corresponding compilers:
     - [ ] Linux (GCC, Clang)
     - [ ] macOS (Clang)
     - [ ] WSL (GCC, Clang)
     - [ ] Cygwin (GCC)
     - [ ] MinGW (GCC/Clang)
     - [ ] Windows (MSVC)
- [?] Add scripts or configurations for cross-platform builds (Linux/macOS/WSL/Cygwin/MinGW)
- [X] Run automated runtime tests with sample targets (8.8.8.8, 1.1.1.1, example.org) and log results
- [ ] Evaluate runtime test results and feed them into further performance and robustness tuning
